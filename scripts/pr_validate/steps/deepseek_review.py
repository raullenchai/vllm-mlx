"""Step 6 — DeepSeek V4 Pro adversarial review of the diff.

Productionizes the one-off /tmp/deepseek_review_*.py scripts we've been
building per-PR. Reads the prompt template from
``scripts/pr_validate/prompts/deepseek_review.md``, sends the diff,
parses the response. Findings are surfaced in the scorecard verbatim
so a maintainer can decide whether to act on each.

Failure policy is deliberately conservative: we mark the step ``fail``
ONLY if DeepSeek's reply contains markers that look like blocking
findings (lines starting with "1.", "2.", … and mentioning specific
files). A reply of "No blocking issues found." → ``pass``. Network
failures or a missing API key → ``skip`` with a clear summary, NOT
``fail`` — we don't want a temporarily-down API to block every PR.
The strictness is at the human-review layer, not the API layer.

The API key MUST be supplied via ``DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`` — there is no
in-source default (the repo is public). Without the env var the step
skips gracefully so contributors without keys can still run the rest
of the pipeline. The user's personal key is documented in
``memory/knowledge/deepseek_api_key.md`` for local development.
