# LLM Inference Efficiency Research -- Top Papers from 2025 Conferences

**(NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, AAAI)**

## Executive Summary

- **Total papers surveyed across 4 conferences:** ~130
- **Papers included (Medium + High Apple Silicon relevance):** 95
- **Breakdown by conference:**
  - NeurIPS 2025: 30 papers (12 High relevance)
  - ICML 2025: 38 papers (22 High relevance)
  - ICLR 2025: 35 papers (23 High relevance)
  - AAAI 2025: 25 papers (12 High relevance)
- **Deduplicated entries:** KVzip (NeurIPS + ICML), DuoAttention (ICLR + roadmap), Sigmoid Attention (ICLR, Apple)

**Key Trends:**

1. **KV cache compression is the dominant theme** -- every conference has 8-12 papers on eviction, quantization, low-rank projection, or sparse representations. The field is converging on 2-4 bit KV caches as practical.
2. **MoE efficiency is surging** -- ICML alone had 10 MoE papers. Expert compression (SVD, delta decomposition), zero-computation experts, and locality-preserving routing address the bandwidth bottleneck that dominates Apple Silicon MoE inference.
3. **Speculative decoding is diversifying** -- model-free (SuffixDecoding, ADED), self-speculative (SWIFT, QuantSpec), and adaptive (BanditSpec) variants eliminate the need for separate draft models.
4. **Reasoning model efficiency is new** -- R-KV, S-GRPO, EAT, DMS, and Think Clearly all target the specific problem of long reasoning chains (R1-style), which generate 10-100x more tokens than standard chat.
5. **Linear/sub-quadratic attention** -- LoLCATs, Sigmoid Attention (Apple), xLSTM, and Cobra/Mamba signal a shift away from softmax attention for inference-constrained settings.
6. **Apple is publishing** -- FlashSigmoid (ICLR), CommVQ (ICML with Apple co-authors), and MLX M5 demos (NeurIPS) show Apple actively investing in on-device inference.
