"""Step 1 — supply chain audit.

What "supply chain" means for an external PR to a published package:

1. **New dependencies** — does this PR add a package to pyproject.toml
   or requirements files? Are those packages known-good or yanked /
   typo-squat / known-vulnerable?
2. **License drift** — pulling in GPL/AGPL/SSPL into our Apache-2.0
   tree would force a relicense; we want to refuse silently-shifted
   licenses.
3. **Install hooks** — `setup.py`, ``pyproject.toml`` build hooks,
   ``conftest.py`` (runs on `pip install` for editable installs and on
   every pytest invocation), and ``.github/workflows/`` (auto-deploys
   to PyPI/Homebrew). Code added to any of these gets to run on every
   user's machine without explicit consent — they need extra scrutiny.
4. **Suspicious patterns in regular code** — base64-decoded blobs that
   `exec()`, ``socket.connect`` to hardcoded IPs, ``urllib`` requests
   to non-anthropic / non-github / non-pypi hosts, ``os.system`` /
   ``subprocess`` with shell-formed strings.

This step is intentionally conservative — we'd rather false-positive
on a benign PR (let the maintainer eyeball it) than miss a malicious
one. The cost of a false positive is "human reads the diff anyway".
The cost of a miss is auto-deploy of malware to every PyPI user.

Network calls (pip-audit) are best-effort; if pip-audit isn't
installed or the index is unreachable we ``skip`` rather than ``fail``
— locally checking deps without network would be misleading.
