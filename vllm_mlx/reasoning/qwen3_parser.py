"""
Reasoning parser for Qwen3 models.

Qwen3 uses <think>...</think> tags for reasoning content and supports
a strict switch via 'enable_thinking=False' in chat template kwargs.

Supports implicit reasoning mode where <think> is injected in the prompt
by AI agents (e.g., OpenCode) and only </think> appears in the output.

    Reasoning parser for Qwen3 models.

    Qwen3 uses <think>...</think> tokens to denote reasoning text.

    Supports three scenarios:
    1. Both tags in output: <think>reasoning</think>content
    2. Only closing tag (think in prompt): reasoning</think>content
    3. No tags: pure content

    Example (normal):
        Input: "<think>Let me analyze this...</think>The answer is 42."
        Output: reasoning="Let me analyze this...", content="The answer is 42."

    Example (think in prompt):
        Input: "Let me analyze this...</think>The answer is 42."
        Output: reasoning="Let me analyze this...", content="The answer is 42."

        doesn't use think tags — all output should have been content.
