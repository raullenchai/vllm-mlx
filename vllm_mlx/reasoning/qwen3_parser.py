"""
Reasoning parser for Qwen3 models.

Qwen3 uses <think>...</think> tags for reasoning content and supports
a strict switch via 'enable_thinking=False' in chat template kwargs.

Supports implicit reasoning mode where <think> is injected in the prompt
by AI agents (e.g., OpenCode) and only </think> appears in the output.

    Reasoning parser for Qwen3 models.

    Qwen3 uses <think>...</think> tokens to denote reasoning text.

    Supports three scenarios:
    1. Both tags in output: <think>reasoning</think>content
    2. Only closing tag (think in prompt): reasoning</think>content
    3. No tags: pure content

    Example (normal):
        Input: "<think>Let me analyze this...</think>The answer is 42."
        Output: reasoning="Let me analyze this...", content="The answer is 42."

    Example (think in prompt):
        Input: "Let me analyze this...</think>The answer is 42."
        Output: reasoning="Let me analyze this...", content="The answer is 42."

        Finalize streaming output.

        Three cases:

        1. No tags seen at all — base class classified everything as reasoning
           (to support implicit think). Emit correction with full text.

        2. <think> seen (template injected or model generated) but </think>
           never appeared — model never produced the closing tag. The base
           class classified everything as reasoning. Emit correction with
           full text (stripping the template-injected <think> prefix).

        3. </think> seen — reasoning was properly completed. Either the model
           produced content after </think> (already emitted as text_delta), or
           the stream ended right at </think>. No correction needed.

        Cases 1 and 2 fix a regression in the Anthropic streaming adapter
        (#185 follow-on): when the chat template injects <think> as a prefix,
        _saw_any_tag is set True from the first delta, preventing the original
        no-tags correction. Checking for </think> presence directly handles
        both the template-injected and genuinely-no-thought scenarios.
