    the server with "No safetensors found" or a torch/mlx-lm error
    halfway through deserialization, both of which surface in the
    scorecard as misleading runtime failures rather than the correct
    "skipped (partial download)" diagnosis.

    Strategy:

    1. If ``model.safetensors.index.json`` is present, parse its
       ``weight_map`` and require every referenced shard to exist
       (and resolve, in case it's a dangling symlink into ../blobs/).
    2. Otherwise, require at least one resolvable ``*.safetensors`` /
       ``*.npz`` / ``*.gguf`` file — a single-file model needs only one,
       and we shouldn't require an index for those.

    Either way: ``resolve(strict=True)`` is what catches dangling
    symlinks, which a plain ``.exists()`` check misses on macOS.
