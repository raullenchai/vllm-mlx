"""Base classes for pipeline steps.

Each step is a small class with three contract points: a name, a
``should_run(ctx)`` predicate (lets us gate expensive steps on blast
radius), and a ``run(ctx) -> StepResult``. Keep step modules
self-contained — the runner doesn't know what each does, only that it
returns a uniform result object the scorecard can render.

We intentionally avoid a plugin registry / entrypoints mechanism. The
runner explicitly imports + orders steps so the pipeline is grep-able
and review-time obvious. Adding a step = one import + one list entry.
